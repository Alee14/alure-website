# Parasite Outbreak
As of recently, we were made aware about the recent outbreak. It may have appeared that it is spreading around the world, we are advising people to be careful when travelling.

# Our response
We have also made a travel advisory statement for people who are travelling around the world. You can find it [here](/travel-advisory).

# What you can do
If you are currently travelling, be sure to self-isolate for 2 weeks at a hotel. If you are currently having symptoms, be sure to contact local health authorities.
