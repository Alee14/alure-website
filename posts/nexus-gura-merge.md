# Nexus Underground and Gura Villa integration into Alure Regions
As there been recent developments in the Southeastern Islands, we are planning on integrating Nexus Underground and Gura Villa into the Alure Regions.

# The Plan
First, they are not planning to be regions, but instead they will be managed by a region.

Nexus Underground is planning on merging into Alee Isle as a borough, but a new name will be chosen to fit in the City of Alee Isle.

Gura Villa is planning on being managed by Silicon Valley as their own land. We are not too sure what will happen to it, but Silicon Valley will be updating on that situation.
